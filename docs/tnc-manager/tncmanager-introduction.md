Terms & Conditions Manager is used to force users to accept the T&C before they can start using the site, or a part of the site.

It is also possible to define multiple T&C that block different contexts. For example, you may want users to accept terms before they start writing blogs on your site. On the same site, you may want users to accept different terms before they can participate in the community. The T&C Manager allows you to do this.

Additionally, it also lets you manage versions of each T&C. If a new version of a T&C is created, te user is forced to accept it again before he can access the protected parts.
